<p>
I automated the process of vacuuming a chamber through developing a
LabVIEW program to pump the vacuum chamber using a vacuum pump, stepper
motor, and throttle valve. The program would initiate the pump and
monitor the pressure and temperature while doing so.

Automating this process would eliminate approximately 0.5 hour of
operator's time wasted daily on pumping the vacuum chamber.

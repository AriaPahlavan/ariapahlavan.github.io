I developed an automation tool from scratch in LabVIEW. The tool is used to automatically operate 
control and operate a vacuum pump and a stepper motor to ajar a throttle valve for pumping a vacuum chamber.
To successfully design and develop this tool, I studied the technical specifications for both the stepper 
motor and vacuum pump, as well as collaborating with a mechanical engineer in my team.

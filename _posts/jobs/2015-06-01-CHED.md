I developed an automation tool in LabVIEW to operate a vacuum pump, stepper motor and throttle valve for pumping a vacuum chamber. The automation tool would automatically use the stepper motor to slowly open the throttle valve, allowing the machine pump the vacuum chamber. As part of the design, the tool was able to monitor the pressure and temperature of the vacuum pump to appropriately adjust the speed of the stepper motor.

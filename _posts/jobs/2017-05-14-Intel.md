<p>
I have been working in a SAFe Scrum team. The "user stories" I accomplish during this internship help with developing the framework architecture of a test generator tool built using C++ and LLVM. This tool is being used throughout the entire validation lifecycles from Simulation to Post Silicon, which enables faster run times on emulation and simulation tools/environments.

As part of working in a SAFe Scrum team, I learned to think big-picture by putting business proposition first; that is to care more about the product than the code being written.

I modified a large-scale LabVIEW program to make it compatible with newer models of cameras used 
for capturing lasers. This modification required fully understanding the pre-developed program, specifically 
the way the program received camera configurations. By doing so and utilizing the camera software
 APIs, I was able to make the initialization process generic, regardless of the model of a camera.
Additionally, I set up and troubleshot computers, network switches, and IP cameras.

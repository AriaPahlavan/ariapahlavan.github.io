<p>
I generified a large-scale laser capturing LabVIEW application to make
it compatible with a variety of cameras used in the laboratory.

<br>

<p>
To do this modification, I needed to fully understand the source code,
identify the places where each camera configurations were being set,
and refactor it into a more generic setup.
</p>

<br>

<p>
By doing so and utilizing the new camera drivers, I was able to make
the initialization process significantly more generic, allowing the
operators to plug and play with newer camera models.

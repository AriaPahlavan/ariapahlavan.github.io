<p>
My summer project at Luminant Power was to develop a technical
specification for an electrical transformer. To do so, I broke down the
project into three step: collaboration, research and development.
</p>

<br>

<p>
First, I collaborated with electrical, mechanical and civil engineering
teams outside of my group to gather valuable technical requirements
regarding the transformer.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Second, I researched different industry standards for
transformers used in power plants.
</p>

<br>

<p>
last, I compiled the resources and data together to develop the desired
purchase specification, which was approved by my mentor.
</p>

<br>

<p>
I believe that collaborating with other engineering disciplines
tremendously increased the reliability of my proposal.

My summer project at Luminant Power was to develop a technical specification for a a transformer. To do so, I broke down the project into three step: collaboration, research and deployment. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
First, I collaborated with electrical, mechanical and civil engineering teams outside of my group to gather technical requirements about the transformer.
Second, I researched different industry standards for transformers used in power plants.
Finally, I effectively brought the resources and data together to develop the desired purchase specification, which was successfully approved by my mentor.

<p>
It is important to note that collaborating with other engineering disciplines tremendously increased the reliability of my proposal.

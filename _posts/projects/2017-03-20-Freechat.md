<p>
Freechat project is a chatroom Android app that I developed in a group
of four students. We developed both the Android app and the servers
servicing the client requests.
</p>

<br>

<p>
I used Android's worker and UI threads (i.e. AsyncTask and
HandlerThread Android APIs) to concurrently update the UI and
communicate with the server. We implemented the server by utilizing
the Ricart and Agrawalaâ€™s algorithm.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Our server-client distributed
system uses TCP protocol to transmit and receive packages between
Android app and the server.

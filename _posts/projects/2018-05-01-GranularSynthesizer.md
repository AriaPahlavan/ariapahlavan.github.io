<p>
For the final project of my embedded systems laboratory class, my
partner and I developed a portable granular synthesizer, which allows
recording a snippet of audio and playing different parts of it at
different times and frequencies.

<p>
I optimized drawing speed on LCD up to 4x through caching pixel
attributes such as pixel color and pixel layer, in an WxH matrix, where
W and H are the width and height of the LCD in pixels, respectively.
</p>

<p>
To be able to store a larger audio sample on the limited storage of the
microcontroller, I increased sound-sampling size from 68KB to 120KB by
compressing sampled audio inputs.

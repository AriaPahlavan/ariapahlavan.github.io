I believe Java8 functional programming and Stream APIs are more efficiently implemented comparing to algorithm and function library in C++1y. 
For this reason I decided to implement a set of APIs similar to those of Java8 for C++1y. I am still in the process of designing and developing the APIs. 
I would also like to utilize all of the goodness provided in C++17.

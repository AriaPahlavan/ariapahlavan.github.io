My idea behind Pastiche was an app that would allow people to be a
voice in different events worldwide. Users would create events,
attendees of an event would add their photos to it, and everyone can
enjoy browsing through their friends photo, which would facilitate
social change. Additionally, the app can also be used as a photo album
to build a collage of photos with friends and family.

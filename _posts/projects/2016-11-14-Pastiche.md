My idea behind Pastiche was to have an app that would allow people to be a void in different events worldwide. Users create events, attendees add their photos to that event, and everyone can enjoy browsing through their friends photo and socialize with one a other. 

The app can also be used as a personal/family photo app and build a collage of photos with your friends.

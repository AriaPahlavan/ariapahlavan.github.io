<p>
I developed an application for simulating/visualizing polynomial regression —through interactive sampling of data— using TensorFlow.js library. I
developed this program with plain JavaScript canvas, and using dat.GUI, I
provided an options setting for the user to change the learning rate, number of
weights, and training optimizer.

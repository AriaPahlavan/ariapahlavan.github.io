<p>
I designed a responsive web app, allowing users find out who's their Celebrity
look-alike, using Clarifai celebrity detection API. The app, as well as its
server and database are all deployed separately on Heroku cloud.

<p>
I was able to increase performance by lazy-loading routes and components, as 
well as, eliminating render blocking bundles in above-the-fold content
</p>

<br>

<p>
I developed the front-end using Node, React, Tachyons, and Particlesjs, and the
back-end using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Clarifai.

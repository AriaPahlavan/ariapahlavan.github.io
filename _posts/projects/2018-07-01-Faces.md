<p>
I designed a responsive web app, allowing users detect faces in an
image, using Clarifai API's.
</p>

<br>

<p>
The front-end is developed using Node, React, Tachyons, and Particlesjs.
</p>

<br>

<p>
The back-end is developed using Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and Clarifai.
</p>


<br>

<p>
The app, server, and database are all deployed separately on the Heroku
cloud.

<p>
ADAS see-through display honors project is a driver 
assistance system with stitched video feed from the perspective of two cars, one behind 
the other, with useful annotated information. The goal of the see-through ADAS is to improve 
situational awareness and efficiency of drivers, so as to reduce driver mistakes on the roads. 
Our design will accomplish this with object recognition, video stitching, and video annotations.

<p>
The object recognition is done by a convolutional neural network model (YOLOv2), and based on its 
results, we annotate the frames using the OpenCV library on Python. The frame stitching is done 
using OpenCV image processing and computer vision APIs, to perform Laplacian pyramid blending.

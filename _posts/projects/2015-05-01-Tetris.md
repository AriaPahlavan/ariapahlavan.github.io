<p>
For the final project in my embedded systems class, my partner and I developed 
a colored version of the retro Tetris game using a Texas Instruments microcontroller and a LCD. 
I continued refining the game after the semester was over and enjoyed playing Tetris over and over! 
It is worth noting that we developed our own DAC for this project, and with the help of my friend 
I was able to play Tetris with the pokemon theme song playing in the background!

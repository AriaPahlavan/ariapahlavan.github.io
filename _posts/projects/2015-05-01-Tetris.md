For the final project in my embedded systems class, my partner and I developed a colored version the retro Tetris game using a Texas Instruments microcontroller. I continued refining the game after the semester was over and enjoyed playing Tetris again. 

We developed our own DAC and with the help of my friend I was able to play Tetris with the pokemon song playing in the background!

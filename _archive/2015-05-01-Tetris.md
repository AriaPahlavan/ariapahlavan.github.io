<p>
For the final project of my embedded systems class, my partner and I
developed a colored version of the retro Tetris game using a Texas
Instruments microcontroller, an LCD, buttons, and a slide pot. I
continued refining the even game after the semester was over and
enjoyed playing Tetris over and over!

It is worth noting that we developed our own DAC for this project, and
with the help of my friend I was able to play the Tetris with pokemon
theme song in the background!

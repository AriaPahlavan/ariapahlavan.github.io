## JavaScript code:
 ```js
for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
    // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4. ->
    console.log('Walking east one step');
}
  ```

## HTML code:
 ```html
<p>This is some text.</p>
  ```

## Bash code
```bash
cat contacts.txt | wc -l
```

And this is an inline code: `(int a) -> (int b) -> a + b;`

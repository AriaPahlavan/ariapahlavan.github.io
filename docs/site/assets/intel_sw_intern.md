I worked in a SAFe Scrum team, where I was able to accomplish many "user
stories", during this internship. I helped with development of a
framework architecture for a test generator tool built in C++ and LLVM.
This tool is being used throughout the entire validation life-cycles
from Simulation to Post Silicon, which enables faster run times on
emulation and simulation tools/environments.

During my internship, I debugged 2 high-priority parser issues that
reduced the compilation time by 15% (45 min) through algorithmic
improvements.

Additionally, I optimized a few thousand lines of legacy code by
applying an object-oriented design, which also enabled concurrency
support in C++.

As part of working in a SAFe Scrum team, I learned to think big-picture
by putting business proposition first; that is to care more about the
product than the code being written. Also, I realized that Agile allows
transparency amongst developers, facilitates communication with
customer, and enables developers to assume responsibility for projects.

I designed a responsive web app, allowing users find out who's their Celebrity look-alike, using Clarifai celebrity detection API. The app, as well as its server and database are all deployed separately on Heroku cloud.


I was able to increase performance by lazy-loading routes and components, as well as, eliminating render blocking bundles in above-the-fold content


I developed the front-end using Node, React, Tachyons, and Particlesjs, and the back-end using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Clarifai.
